= Public-key infrastructure

This repository contains complex {pki_url_nice_label} solution with detailed description. All questions related to the content please send to tomasz.orlowski@creotech.pl.

== General overview and scope of this document

A {pki_url_nice_label} is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke {pub_key_cert_nice_label}s and using {pub_key_crypto_url_nice_label}.

IMPORTANT: This document covers only small subset of extensive {computer_security_url_nice_label} subject and focuses only on technical aspects of the implementation. It is mainly based of {nsc_url_nice_label}, particulary {nsc_800_52_url_nice_label} reated to {nist_url_nice_label}, particulary {nist_800_52_url_nice_label}.

This document covers mainly {tls_url_nice_label} and {vpn_url_nice_label} appraoches and highlights fundamental differences between these two technoogies. Both can be used for secure communication but they differ mainly by area of interest and when/where it should be used.

{tls_url_nice_label} is a {crypt_protocol_url_nice_label} designed to provide communications {computer_security_url_nice_label} over a {computer_network_url_nice_label}, such as the Internet. The {comm_protocol_url_nice_label} is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing {https_url_nice_label} remains the most publicly visible including {rest_url_nice_label} solutions.

The {tls_url_nice_label} protocol aims primarily to provide security, including privacy (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity through the use of {cryptography_url_nice_label}, such as the use of {pub_key_cert_nice_label}, between two or more communicating computer {application_url_nice_label}s. It runs in the {presentation_layer_url_nice_label} and is itself composed of two layers: the {tls_url_nice_label} record and the {tls_url_nice_label} {handshake_url_nice_label} {comm_protocol_url_nice_label}.

{vpn_url_nice_label} is a {computer_network_url_nice_label} architecture for virtually extending a private network, i.e. any network which is not the public Internet, across one or multiple other networks which are either untrusted or need to be isolated.

A {vpn_url_nice_label} can extend access to a private network to users who do not have direct access to it, such as an office network allowing secure access from off-site over the Internet. This is achieved by creating a link between computing devices and {computer_network_url_nice_label}s by the use of network tunneling protocols using {data_link_layer_url_nice_label} or {network_layer_url_nice_label}, depending on needs.

IMPORTANT: Main differnece between {tls_url_nice_label} and {vpn_url_nice_label} is that {tls_url_nice_label} interconnects securely {application_url_nice_label}s on {presentation_layer_url_nice_label} level while {vpn_url_nice_label} interconnects securely {computer_url_nice_label}s and {computer_appliance_url_nice_label}s on {data_link_layer_url_nice_label} or {network_layer_url_nice_label}.

== General solution architecture description

{tls_url_nice_label} based on {pki_url_nice_label} consist of three main groups:

* <<Certificate Authority>>
* <<TLS Server>>
* <<TLS Client>>

.todo:

* Add the same form about VPN and write main groups with additional sections for it.

=== Certificate Authority

In {cryptography_url_nice_label}, a {ca_url_nice_label} is an entity that stores, signs, and issues {pub_key_cert_nice_label}s. A {pub_key_cert_nice_label} proves the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the {pub_key_cert_nice_label}. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon {digital_signature_url_nice_label} or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A {ca_url_nice_label} acts as a {trusted_third_party_url_nice_label} trusted both by the subject (owner) of the {pub_key_cert_nice_label} and by the party relying upon the {pub_key_cert_nice_label}. The format of these certificates is specified by the {x509_url_nice_label} standard.

.todo:

* Add paragraph about revoke {pub_key_cert_nice_label}s and why it is imporatnt from our point of view.

=== TLS Server

This is name for {server_url_nice_label} related to {tls_url_nice_label} according to {client_server_url_nice_label} model. TLS Server acts as topological central point for several <<TLS Client>>s and is able to manage multiple connections at once. Most common approach and good practice is to locate it inside known area of network, inside premises, and on own managed and trusted environment. From architecture point of view it should act as known internal resource, where external clients is able to connect to on demand. It should listen and be available all the time so technique like {high_availability_url_nice_label} is applied to achieve this goal. Behind it actual application is located which delivers target buissness logic. Good example is {microservic_url_nice_label} using {rest_url_nice_label} API available in public {computer_network_url_nice_label}.

=== TLS Client

.todo:

* Write short description what is client in TLS.

{client_url_nice_label} according to {client_server_url_nice_label} model.

=== Establishing a SSL/TLS Session

{tls_url_nice_label} is used for secure communication between the <<TLS Client>> side and <<TLS Server>> side in the {presentation_layer_url_nice_label}. Simplified connection establishment is presented in the diagram below.

[plantuml, format="png", id="simplified_tls_connection_establishment"]
----
@startuml

participant "TLS Client" as client
participant "TLS Server" as server

group Secure connection establishment
client -> server: Hello. I want to establish secure connection with you, because I know who you are.
server -> client: Hello. I know who you are too so sure, let's do it.
end

group Secure connection
client <-> server: Secure bidirectional data exchange
end

@enduml
----

Always <<TLS Client>> initializates connection by sending "hello" message to the <<TLS Server>>. In practice, this process can be more complicated and indeed it is. It consist of two parts: the handshake and actual secure session. The main complication is making sure, that both sides know each ohter. Diagram below presents more advanced overview of the process.

[plantuml, format="png", id="advanced_tls_connection_establishment"]
----
@startuml

actor User
participant "TLS Client" as client
participant "TLS Server" as server

User->client: Start secure session

group TCP
client->server: SYN
server->client: SYN ACK
client->server: ACK
end

group TLS handshake (unencrypted part)
client->server: ClientHello
server->client: ServerHello
server->client: ServerCertyficate (authentication)
server->client: ServerHelloDone
client->server: ClientKeyExchange Message
client->server: ChangeCipherSpec
client->server: Finished
server->client: ChangeCipherSpec
server->client: Finished
end

group TLS session (encrypted part)
client<->server: Secure bidirectional data exchange
end

@enduml
----

This communication can differ in many ways depending on the configuration applied. Good practices are described in {nsc_800_52_url_nice_label} based on  {nist_800_52_url_nice_label}. Detailed configuration aspects are not important for understanding the general building blocks of the architecture and is out of scope of this document.

The important detail in the diagram presented is described as authentication. The <<TLS Client>> verifies the <<TLS Server>>'s {pub_key_cert_nice_label} with the <<Certificate Authority>> that issued it. This confirms that the <<TLS Server>> is who it says it is, and that the <<TLS Client>> is interacting with the actual owner of the domain. Here comes the <<Certificate Authority>> as important player in {tls_url_nice_label} handshake, which is essencial in secure communication establishment.

.todo:

* Add paragraph about relation to Certificate Authority
* Add paragraph about certificate revocation here and underline, why it is important.

== VS Code developer manual

List of useful {vscode_url_nice_label} extentions used for development:

* AsciiDoc
* PlantUML Viewer
* Docker

=== AsciiDoc

If you want to see generated `{some_source_file_adoc}` preview open file you are interrested in and press `ctrl+shift+v` key combination. New window should appear containing your generated `{some_source_file_adoc}` preview.

=== PlantUML Viewer

If you want to see generated `{some_source_file_puml}` preview open file you are interrested in and press `alt+d` key combination. Preview window should appear next to your `{some_source_file_puml}` code.

=== Docker

Docker extension is used only to see currently running images. It is not mandatory. It is possible to check status of running PlantUML server docker image via CLI. Check section dedicated to <<PlantUML Server>> for details.

== PlantUML Server

According to the README article {asciidoctor_plantuml_url_nice_label} PlantUML Server can be launched locally in {docker_url_nice_label} via command line.

[subs="+attributes"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker run -d --name {plantuml_server_name} -p 8081:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty
f12e5651ee03a2f53fe6cc5d21529d5ef0611005a4a46f66aa5c4f29e9ed4528
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can verify if PlantUML Server {docker_url_nice_label} container is already running from command line.

[subs="+attributes"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[{local_user}@{local_hostname} ~]$ docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep {plantuml_server_name}
{plantuml_server_name}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If command gives empty output, probably container is not running.
